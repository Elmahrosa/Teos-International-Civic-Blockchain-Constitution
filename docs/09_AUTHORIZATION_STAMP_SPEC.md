## Purpose

The **Authorization Stamp** is the cryptographic enforcement mechanism of the  
**TEOS Sovereign Authority Chain**.

It provides **machine-verifiable, non-repudiable proof** that a requested action:

1. Originated from a valid, registered authority level  
2. Passed all mandatory governance and safety controls  
3. Was explicitly approved by accountable human institutional authority  
4. Fully complies with **ICBC constitutional rules** and **TESL licensing constraints**

> **No execution may occur without a valid Authorization Stamp.**

This requirement is **absolute**, not advisory.

---

## Constitutional Principle

> **Authority flows downward only.**  
> Execution never creates authority.

The Authorization Stamp is the **sole admissible proof** that an action has
lawfully traversed the Authority Chain:

**ICBC → Governance → Safety → Execution**

Any action lacking this traversal is **constitutionally void** and MUST NOT be executed.

---

## Scope of Use

Authorization Stamps are **MANDATORY** for all state-affecting or sovereign actions, including:

- Treasury operations (vault creation, transfers, burns)
- Policy execution or enforcement
- Governance parameter changes
- AI-assisted, semi-automated, or fully automated actions
- Any action mutating sovereign data, funds, rights, or registries

Authorization Stamps are **NOT required** for:

- Read-only queries
- Public or non-sensitive data access
- Passive, non-mutating audit inspection

---

## Authorization Stamp Data Model (Canonical)

All required fields are mandatory.  
Their absence **invalidates** the Authorization Stamp.

Optional fields may only **further restrict execution or improve auditability**  
and MUST NEVER weaken, bypass, or reduce enforcement.

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `stamp_version` | Canonical version identifier (e.g., `AUTH-1.0`) |
| `action_id` | Globally unique identifier for the requested action |
| `action_type` | Enumerated action class (e.g., `VAULT_TRANSFER`) |
| `request_hash` | SHA-256 hash of the canonical action payload |
| `authority_chain_hash` | SHA-256 hash of the canonical `AUTHORITY-CHAIN.md` |
| `pai_receipt_hash` | Hash of the linked PAI Receipt (if applicable) |
| `initiator_pubkey` | Public key of the initiating authority |
| `governance_signature` | Governance-layer signature over `STAMP_HASH` |
| `safety_signature` | Safety / AI Guard signature over `STAMP_HASH` |
| `execution_scope` | Explicit, bounded scope of permitted execution |
| `issued_at_utc` | ISO-8601 UTC issuance timestamp |
| `expiry_utc` | Optional expiration timestamp (strongly recommended) |

---

## Canonicalization & Hashing

1. Serialize all required fields into **canonical JSON**:
   - Lexicographically sorted keys  
   - UTF-8 encoding  
   - Deterministic formatting (no whitespace ambiguity)

2. Compute:

```text
STAMP_HASH = SHA-256(canonical_json_string)
````

The `STAMP_HASH` is the **single immutable authority reference**.

---

## Signature Requirements

### Mandatory Signatures

| Layer             | Requirement            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Governance        | MUST sign `STAMP_HASH` |
| Safety / AI Guard | MUST sign `STAMP_HASH` |
| Execution         | **MUST NEVER sign**    |

> Execution is constitutionally prohibited from generating or endorsing authority.

### Signature Rules

* One cryptographic scheme **system-wide only** (Ed25519 or ECDSA)
* Public keys MUST be:

  * Registered
  * Badge-verified
  * Revocation-tracked
* Any missing, malformed, expired, or invalid signature results in **automatic rejection**

## Authorization Flow (Conceptual)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant R as Requestor
    participant G as Governance
    participant S as Safety / AI Guard
    participant E as Execution Kernel

    R->>G: Submit Action + Payload
    G->>G: Policy & ICBC Validation
    G->>S: Safety Review Request
    S->>S: Risk, Abuse & Compliance Analysis
    S-->>G: Safety Approval Signature
    G-->>R: Authorization Stamp Issued
    R->>E: Execute(Action, AuthorizationStamp)
    E->>E: Deterministic Verification
    E-->>R: Execution Allowed / Denied
```

---

## Execution Kernel Enforcement Rules

The Execution Kernel **MUST** perform the following checks **in strict order**:

1. **Stamp presence**
   → Reject if missing

2. **Stamp hash integrity**
   → Recompute and compare

3. **Authority chain consistency**
   → `authority_chain_hash` MUST match the current canonical document

4. **Signature verification**

   * Governance signature valid
   * Safety signature valid

5. **Scope enforcement**
   → Action MUST be fully contained within `execution_scope`

6. **Expiry enforcement** (if defined)

> Failure at any step **halts execution immediately**.

---

## Minimal Verification Logic (Pseudocode)

```text
FUNCTION verify_and_execute(action_payload, authorization_stamp):

  ASSERT authorization_stamp EXISTS

  computed_hash = SHA256(canonicalize(authorization_stamp))
  ASSERT computed_hash == authorization_stamp.STAMP_HASH

  ASSERT verify_signature(
    governance_pubkey,
    authorization_stamp.STAMP_HASH,
    authorization_stamp.governance_signature
  )

  ASSERT verify_signature(
    safety_pubkey,
    authorization_stamp.STAMP_HASH,
    authorization_stamp.safety_signature
  )

  ASSERT action_payload.hash IN authorization_stamp.execution_scope

  IF authorization_stamp.expiry_utc EXISTS:
    ASSERT now_utc < authorization_stamp.expiry_utc

  EXECUTE action_payload
```

---

## Forbidden Fields & Patterns (Normative)

The following are **explicitly forbidden** and MUST cause rejection if present:

* Any field attempting to:

  * Bypass governance or safety checks
  * Broaden execution scope implicitly (e.g., `ANY`, `ALL`)
  * Grant self-authorization
  * Override ICBC constraints
* Any dynamic or executable code embedded in the stamp
* Any reference to mutable or off-chain authority sources

---

## Relationship to PAI Receipt

* **PAI Receipt** → proves *right to participate*
* **Authorization Stamp** → proves *right to execute*

For sovereign or high-impact actions, the Authorization Stamp **SHOULD**
reference `pai_receipt_hash` to preserve full provenance continuity.

---

## Audit & Transparency Requirements

All Authorization Stamps MUST be:

* Logged in an append-only or on-chain registry
* Immutable after issuance
* Time-indexed and hash-addressable
* Retrievable by authorized auditors

Execution logs MUST reference the corresponding `STAMP_HASH`.

---

## Failure Modes (Intentional by Design)

| Failure Condition            | Result         |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| Missing signature            | Reject         |
| Invalid or revoked signature | Reject         |
| Authority chain mismatch     | Reject         |
| Scope violation              | Reject         |
| Expired stamp                | Reject         |
| Self-authorization attempt   | Reject + Alert |

---

## Security Guarantees

The Authorization Stamp guarantees:

* No AI operates without human institutional approval
* No API bypasses governance
* No execution outranks constitutional law
* No silent or implicit automation
* No retroactive or post-facto authorization

---

## Non-Negotiable Rule

> **If an action does not carry a valid Authorization Stamp, it does not exist.**

This rule is **constitutionally LOCKED** by the ICBC and
cannot be overridden by code, policy, emergency powers, or majority vote.
