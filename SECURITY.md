# Security & Vulnerability Disclosure

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please disclose it privately via email to: security@elmahrosa.example (placeholder — update to real address).
Provide: steps to reproduce, affected components, suggested remediation, and contact info for follow-up.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy
- We will acknowledge receipt within 5 business days.
- We aim to provide a remediation timeline and coordinate disclosure.
- Do not publish vulnerabilities before a coordinated disclosure or fix.

## Security Practices
- All contracts must be unit tested and audited for critical deployments.
- Follow secure key management for multisigs and operator keys.
- Off-chain PII must never be stored on public ledgers.
