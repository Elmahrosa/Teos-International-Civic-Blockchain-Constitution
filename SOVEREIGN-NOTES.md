# TEOS — SOVEREIGN NOTES  
## Founder Constitutional Record

**Repository:** Teos-International-Civic-Blockchain-Constitution  
**Status:** Active / Canonical  
**Owner:** Elmahrosa International  
**Scope:** Constitutional decisions, locked principles, and strategic constraints  
**Purpose:** Serve as the single source of truth for founder-level intent and non-negotiable rules

---

## 1. Constitutional Position (Locked)

- TEOS is a **sovereign software framework**, not a platform, not a protocol sale, and not an equity vehicle.
- All authority derives exclusively from the **International Civic Blockchain Constitution**.
- No component (code, API, AI, partner system) may operate outside the constitutional authority chain.

**Rule (Non-Negotiable):**  
No code, no API, no AI, and no partnership is valid outside the sovereign authority chain.

---

## 2. Founder Sovereignty (Locked)

- Founder retains **100% constitutional and sovereign authority** over TEOS.
- No equity, ownership, IP control, or final governance authority is transferred under any circumstance.
- Financial participation is structured exclusively through **sovereign usage rights**, not ownership.

Founder authority is structural and constitutional — not financial.

---

## 3. Rights Model (Locked)

- TEOS does **not** sell equity.
- TEOS does **not** allocate ownership percentages.
- TEOS operates a **Rights Capacity Framework** based on:
  - Access classes
  - Maximum access caps
  - Indicative (non-binding) funding ranges

All figures shown in diagrams or documents represent **maximum access caps**, not allocations.

---

## 4. Access Classes & Indicative Ranges (Guidance Only)

The following ranges are **non-binding**, subject to bilateral or multilateral sovereign agreements:

### 4.1 Founding Nations
- **Access Cap:** up to 20% (collective)
- **Indicative Range:** USD 3M – 8M per nation
- **Form:** Bilateral sovereign agreement

### 4.2 Institutions
- **Access Cap:** up to 10% (collective)
- **Indicative Range:** USD 1M – 3M per institution
- **Form:** Licensed institutional deployment

### 4.3 Regional Alliances
- **Access Cap:** up to 25% (collective)
- **Indicative Range:** USD 7.5M – 20M per hub
- **Form:** Multi-nation coordination framework

### 4.4 Tokenized Infrastructure
- **Access Cap:** Variable
- **Condition:** Asset-backed issuance only
- **Restriction:** No speculative or unsecured minting

Unallocated capacity remains dormant by default.

---

## 5. Authority Chain (Final & Locked)

The following authority chain is final and non-negotiable:

```

International Civic Blockchain Constitution
→ TEOS-FORGE
→ TEOS-Governance
→ TEOS-Compliance-Kit (Country Profile)
→ TEOS-AI-Guard
→ TEOS-AI-Auditor
→ Teos-Sovereign-System
→ TEOS-API-Sovereign
→ External Apps / Nations / Partners

```

Any component outside this chain is **unauthorized**.

---

## 6. Globalization Principle (Locked)

- TEOS globalizes through **National Adapter Layers**, not through centralization.
- Each country maintains:
  - Its own laws
  - Its own constitution
  - Its own compliance profile
- Global interoperability must never override national sovereignty.

There is no “one-size-fits-all” deployment.

---

## 7. Licensing & Legal Posture (Locked)

- **TESL** is the sole governing license of the TEOS sovereign stack.
- The system is:
  - Source-available
  - Non-open-source
  - Constitution-bound
- Any use, fork, or deployment outside TESL and constitutional authority is invalid.

---

## 8. Institutional & UN Alignment (Confirmed Direction)

- TEOS is positioned for:
  - Government deployment
  - UN-supported DPI programs
  - IFI-funded national implementations
- Priority SDGs:
  - **SDG 16.9** — Legal Identity
  - **SDG 17.17** — Partnerships
- Alignment with:
  - Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)
  - GovStack principles

TEOS is offered as **sovereign software infrastructure**, not as a vendor-controlled service.

---

## 9. Engagement Strategy (Current Position)

- Engagement is **online-first** by default.
- Physical travel occurs only after:
  - Institutional alignment
  - Document review
  - Formal invitation
- No pitching without governance context.

Documentation precedes meetings.

---

## 10. What Is Explicitly NOT Decided (Open)

The following are intentionally left undecided:

- First adopting jurisdiction
- Exact funding totals
- Legal wrapper per country
- Timeline for regional rollout
- Depth of initial technical deployment

These are resolved **only** through sovereign agreements.

---

## 11. Change Policy

- Any change to a **Locked** section requires:
  - Explicit founder decision
  - Documentation in `DECISION-LOG.md`
- No silent changes.
- No retroactive reinterpretation.

---

**Document Status:**  
Active — Founder Record  
Non-Marketing — Non-Promotional  
Canonical unless superseded by constitutional amendment
```
