# 🔒 **REPO_LOCK — Canonical Hash Registry & Repository Lock**

**Repository:** Teos-International-Civic-Blockchain-Constitution (ICBC)
**Maintainer / Coordinating Authority:** Elmahrosa International
**Governing Law & Venue:** Cairo, Arab Republic of Egypt
**Status:** **CONSTITUTIONALLY LOCKED**

---

## 1. Purpose & Legal Effect

This document serves as the **Canonical Hash Registry** and **Repository Lock Declaration**
for the **International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)**.

It establishes:

* Which documents are **constitutionally binding**
* Which cryptographic hashes are **legally authoritative**
* The conditions under which **any change is valid or invalid**

**Any discrepancy** between a document’s content and its registered SHA-256 hash
renders that document **non-canonical, invalid, and without legal effect**.

This file is **operative law**, not descriptive text.

---

## 2. Constitutional Authority

This Registry is binding under:

* **International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)**
* **Article IX — Cryptographic Enforcement of Authority**
* **ICBC-ANNEX-CI-01 — Cryptographic Integrity & Evidentiary Status**

This file constitutes the **single source of truth** for document integrity
within this repository.

---

## 3. Canonical Hash Registry (Authoritative)

All hashes below use:

* **Algorithm:** SHA-256
* **Encoding:** UTF-8
* **Digest Format:** Lowercase hexadecimal
