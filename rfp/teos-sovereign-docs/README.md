1. **Constitutional Supremacy**  
   The ICBC is the sole canonical authority governing all deployments.

2. **Usage Rights Only**  
   Access is granted strictly as **Sovereign Usage Rights**.  
   No IP transfer, no equity rights, no token dependency.

3. **Geopolitical Capacity Control**  
   Regional participation is capped at **25% of total global access capacity**  
   to preserve multipolar, non-aligned balance and prevent bloc capture.
