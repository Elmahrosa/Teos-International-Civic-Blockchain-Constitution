## ⚖️ Authority Rules

- Authority **always flows downward**
- Execution **never creates authority**
- AI **never decides**
- APIs **never bypass governance**
- Compliance **must pass before execution**
- Audit evidence **must exist for every action**

Any system attempting to bypass or reorder this chain
is considered **non-compliant and unauthorized**.
