# 🔔 TEOS Contribution Governance Rules
“Contribution does not imply governance rights or authority.”
### Petition-First | Badge-Gated | Validator-Logged

🚨 **Petition-First Enforcement** 🚨  
No code, governance, documentation, or protocol contribution shall be accepted
unless the contributor has signed the official TEOS civic petition.

👉 Official Petition:  
https://www.change.org/p/join-the-movement-sign-the-petition-to-regulate-digital-currencies-in-egypt

## ✅ Mandatory Contribution Requirements

All contributors must provide:

- Proof of petition signature  
  (profile link, comment link, or screenshot)
- Valid **TEOS Civic Badge** assigned and verified
- Explicit acceptance of TEOS constitutional authority

Pull requests missing these requirements are automatically rejected.

## 🔄 Contribution Validation Flow

1. Petition signature completed
2. Civic badge assignment request
3. Pull request submission with proof
4. Constitutional & technical review by validator
5. Merge decision recorded immutably in `chapter_resurrection.md`

All merges require validator consensus and constitutional compliance.

## ⚠ Enforcement Clause

Contribution access is a **civic privilege**, not an open right.

Violation, impersonation, or falsification results in:
- Immediate rejection
- Audit flagging
- Permanent exclusion if repeated
