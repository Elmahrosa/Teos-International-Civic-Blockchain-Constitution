## 🧭 Foundational Declaration

This Constitution establishes TEOS as a **sovereign civic blockchain ecosystem**
born in Egypt, grounded in real regulatory and civic constraints,
and engineered for global, nation-ready deployment.

Egypt — *Om el Donia (Mother of the World)* — has historically shaped law,
governance, and public order.  
TEOS inherits this role by transforming Egyptian civic principles
into exportable digital public infrastructure.

This Constitution is the **highest authority** governing all TEOS protocols,
institutions, contributors, validators, and deployments.
