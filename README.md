## 🌍 Constitutional Origin

This constitution — and the TEOS ecosystem it governs — is **born in Egypt**,
shaped by real civic constraints, regulatory realities, and national identity systems,
and **engineered for the world** as a modular, exportable sovereign infrastructure framework.

Egypt — *Om el Donia (Mother of the World)* — has historically served as a cradle of
law, governance, and civic order.  
TEOS inherits this legacy by transforming Egyptian civic foundations
into globally deployable constitutional technology.
