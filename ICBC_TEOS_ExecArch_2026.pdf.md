**Executive Architecture — 2026 (Condensed, Sovereign Edition)**

## 1. Authority Chain

- **Hierarchy:** Constitution → Governance → Execution (**Non-Bypassable**)
- **Law Over Code:** Human and institutional authority supersedes all automation.
- **License:** Source-Available under the **TEOS Egypt Sovereign License (TESL)**; authority and branding are non-forkable.
- **Identity Model:** Citizen, Institutional, and Founder roles verified via real-world identity (KYC / national systems). No token-based rights.

## 2. Technical Stack

### Core Sovereign Contracts (.pi)

- `CivicConstitution.pi`  
  Citizen registration and legal identity anchoring.

- `PolicyRatification.pi`  
  **Institutional and lawful ratification** of decisions.  
  *No DAO, no token voting, no quadratic mechanisms.*

- `SovereignDistribution.pi`  
  **State-authorized stipends and programmatic disbursements**, executed only under institutional approval.  
  *(Not UBI experimentation.)*

### Multi-Chain Anchors

- **Solana (Anchor):**  
  Petitions, attestations, and immutable audit logs.

- **Ethereum (Solidity):**  
  Institutional asset registry with verifiable metadata.

### Frontend

- **Constitution Portal (Next.js):**  
  Identity-gated access only; no public or permissionless interaction surfaces.
