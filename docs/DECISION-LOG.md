**Repository:** Teos-International-Civic-Blockchain-Constitution  
**Status:** LOCKED / CANONICAL  
**Founder:** Ayman Seif  
**Scope:** Global Sovereign Digital Public Infrastructure  

**Rule:** No silent changes. Any modification to a [LOCKED] decision requires an explicit entry in this log.

## 🧭 01 — Authority & Constitutional Governance

- **[LOCKED] Constitutional Supremacy**  
  The *International Civic Blockchain Constitution* is the sole canonical source of authority.  
  No code, API, AI, or partnership may operate outside the sovereign authority chain.

- **[LOCKED] Finalized Authority Chain**  
```

Constitution
→ TEOS-FORGE
→ TEOS-Governance
→ TEOS-Compliance-Kit (Country Profile)
→ TEOS-AI-Guard
→ TEOS-AI-Auditor
→ Teos-Sovereign-System
→ TEOS-API-Sovereign
→ External Entities

```
*Rationale:* Establishes a non-negotiable order of control, accountability, and escalation.

- **[LOCKED] Founder-Controlled Constitutional Authority**  
100% of the core protocol’s constitutional authority remains under **Founder-controlled sovereign oversight**.  
Sovereignty must remain structurally intact to prevent governance fragmentation.

---

## 🛡️ 02 — Rights Model & Legal Anchoring

- **[LOCKED] Access Rights vs. Ownership**  
TEOS grants **Sovereign Usage Rights** only.  
It does not transfer equity, ownership, or intellectual property.

*Rationale:* Prevents institutional capture and preserves long-term civic integrity.

- **[LOCKED] Rights Capacity Framing**  
Rights are expressed strictly as **“Rights Capacity / Access Caps”**, never as allocation percentages.

*Rationale:* Eliminates equity inference and strengthens regulatory defensibility.

- **[GUIDANCE] Non-Binding Ranges**  
Any pricing, capacity, or funding ranges are indicative only and non-binding, preserving honesty and negotiation flexibility.

- **[LOCKED] TESL Anchor**  
The **TESL (Teos Ethical Sovereign License)** governs the entire sovereign stack.  
All repositories must maintain explicit and consistent references to this canonical license.

## 📈 03 — Access Classes & Capacity Caps (Indicative)

- **[GUIDANCE] Founding Nations**  
Collective Access Cap: up to **20%**  
Focus: Bilateral sovereign agreements for national DPI deployment.

- **[GUIDANCE] Institutions**  
Collective Access Cap: up to **10%**  
Focus: Licensed institutional deployments (banking, IFIs, sector-specific systems).

- **[GUIDANCE] Regional Alliances**  
Collective Access Cap: up to **25%**  
Focus: Multi-nation coordination hubs (e.g., ASEAN, AU, GCC).  
*Note:* Higher value is justified only at the regional coordination layer.

- **[LOCKED] Tokenized Infrastructure**  
Variable access only. **Asset-backed issuance exclusively.**  
No speculative or unsecured minting is permitted.

- **[LOCKED] Dormant Capacity Principle**  
All unallocated capacity remains dormant by default to preserve protocol scarcity and sovereignty.

---

## 🌍 04 — Globalization & National Localization

- **[LOCKED] National Adapter Layer (NAL)**  
Globalization occurs exclusively through **Country Profiles**, not centralization.  
Each nation retains its own constitutional and legal logic without breaking the global authority chain.

- **[LOCKED] Compliance Localization**  
The `TEOS-Compliance-Kit` must be localized per jurisdiction.  
Compliance is national by nature; the framework remains universal.

---

## 🤝 05 — Institutional Engagement Strategy

- **[LOCKED] RFP-First Adoption Track**  
Sovereign adoption is document-driven.  
`rfp/GOVERNMENT_OVERVIEW.md` is the primary entry point for all official procurement and dialogue.

- **[GUIDANCE] SDG Alignment**  
Maintain formal compatibility with:
- **SDG 16.9** — Legal Identity  
- **SDG 17.17** — Multi-stakeholder Partnerships  
via `rfp/UN_SDG_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

- **[LOCKED] Documentation Precedence & Engagement Mode**  
Formal documentation must precede meetings.  
Engagement is **Online-First** by default.  
Physical travel is authorized only after structural alignment and official invitation.
