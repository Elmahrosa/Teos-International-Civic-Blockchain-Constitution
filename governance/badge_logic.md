# Badge Logic

## Assignment Flow
1. Contributor signs petition  
2. Validator reviews and assigns badge  
3. Badge tier logged in `chapter_resurrection.md`  
4. Badge gates enforced via `badge_gate.bat`

## Badge Tiers
- Citizen: entry-level, petition-signed  
- Validator: audit and approval rights  
- Founder: full governance and treasury control

## Enforcement
- All flows gated by badge tier  
- No anonymous actions allowed  
- Badge registry: `registry/badges.json`
