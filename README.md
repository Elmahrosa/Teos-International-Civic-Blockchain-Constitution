## Roadmap — Earnings First, Anchoring Later

### Purpose
- This constitution is civic-first: petition-based onboarding, badge enforcement, transparent vault registry, and rigorous logging.  
- **Operational backbone**: FPBE Bank handles flows and custody.  
- **Final anchor of trust**: Teos-Gold-Reserve, activated only after the ecosystem earns sufficient on-chain liquidity to purchase real gold and deposit it with FPBE.  

---

### Step 1 — Civic Mixer (Teos-Civic-Mixer)
- Petition-first flows and badge-gated onboarding for clean civic liquidity.  
- Earnings: transaction fees, early staking unlocks.  
- Transparency: audits/transparency_log.md updates for each mixer release.  
- Fixes: petition link refresh, badge sync.  

### Step 2 — FPBE Bank Backbone
- Route all civic and treasury flows through FPBE as the operational core.  
- Earnings: treasury shares, validator fees, custody services.  
- Transparency: custody events and vault changes logged in audits/transparency_log.md.  
- **Note**: This is where gold will ultimately be deposited.  

### Step 3 — Gaza Reconstruction
- Humanitarian pipelines with donation flows and impact tracking.  
- Earnings: donation credits, civic reputation.  
- Transparency: inflows/outflows logged in audits/transparency_log.md.  
- Fixes: Firebase sync, petition enforcement.  

### Step 4 — ERT Launch
- Founder injection and activation of TEOS + ERT with staking and swaps.  
- Earnings: staking rewards, swap fees, validator participation.  
- Transparency: audits/token_events.md and transparency_log.md.  
- Fixes: token address sync, mixer verification.  

### Step 5 — Pi Smart City
- Governance and civic services via Pi SDK for urban coordination.  
- Earnings: validator shares, treasury flows tied to city services.  
- Transparency: service KPIs and validator maps in dashboard modules.  
- Fixes: SDK integration, badge enforcement.  

### Step 6 — AI Auditor
- Automated transparency enforcement, anomaly detection, and reputational scoring.  
- Earnings: validator bonuses tied to audit compliance; contributor reputation accrual.  
- Transparency: periodic audit runs logged in audits/transparency_log.md.  
- Fixes: audit engine rerun, log sync.  

### Step 7 — NFT Generator
- Minting, royalties, and staking-enabled creator economy.  
- Earnings: mint fees, royalties, staking rewards.  
- Transparency: royalties ledger entries in dashboard/integrity_ledger.md.  
- Fixes: wallet sync, royalty engine.  

### Step 8 — Salma Hospital
- Healthcare impact rails: donations, service credits, and patient-support flows.  
- Earnings: donation-based flows, service credits, outcome-linked rewards.  
- Transparency: healthcare-specific reports in audits/transparency_log.md.  
- Fixes: file renaming, civic sync.  

### Step 9 — Teos-Gold-Reserve (Activated After Earnings)
- Convert earned liquidity into real gold; deposit into FPBE Bank vault for final trust anchor.  
- **Activation criteria**:  
  - Sustained ecosystem TVL above target threshold.  
  - 90-day audit-clean liquidity flows recorded in transparency_log.md.  
  - Custody and compliance checks passed per treasury_rules.md.  
- Earnings: gold-backed yield mechanics; treasury stability and credibility.  
- Transparency: proof-of-reserve entries and vault deposit events logged in audits/transparency_log.md.  
- **Note**: This is the last step — only after strong liquidity is earned through prior steps.  

---

### Contributor Checklist
- Update **audits/transparency_log.md** with clear, timestamped entries.  
- Align with **compliance/** (treasury_rules.md, custody.md).  
- Sync workflows (petition-enforcement.yml) with civic and registry changes.  
- Map PRs to relevant module folders with rationale in commit messages.
