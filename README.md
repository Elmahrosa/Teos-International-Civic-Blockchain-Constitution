### **Supreme Charter of the TEOS Sovereign Stack**

🇪🇬 *Authored in Egypt — enforceable by institutions and nations worldwide.*

**Law before code.**  
**Governance before execution.**  
**Human authority before automation.**

</div>

## Final Summary

The **Teos International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)** is the **supreme
governance and legal charter** of the TEOS ecosystem. It establishes a
constitutionally governed civic blockchain framework designed to integrate
distributed technologies with **human institutional authority**, international
law, and public accountability.

The Constitution defines the lawful boundaries within which blockchain systems,
artificial intelligence, and digital public infrastructure may operate. It
explicitly affirms that **law governs code**, and that all technical systems
exist solely as instruments of authorized human governance.

---

## Foundational Principles

The Constitution is anchored in five non-negotiable principles:

1. **Sovereignty**  
   Sovereignty resides in lawful human and institutional authority.  
   No protocol, algorithm, token, or AI system may claim or generate sovereign
   power.

2. **Governance Before Execution**  
   All execution is subordinate to prior governance authorization.  
   Systems may enforce decisions, but may never originate authority.

3. **Accountability and Auditability**  
   All governance actions, executions, and enforcement outcomes must be
   traceable, reviewable, and subject to constitutional audit.

4. **Human Authority Over Automation**  
   Artificial intelligence and automated systems are strictly
   decision-support tools.  
   Final authority always remains human, institutional, and accountable.

5. **Jurisdictional Compatibility**  
   The framework is designed to operate in harmony with national and
   international legal systems, enabling lawful civic and public-sector
   adoption.

---

## Constitutional Scope

The Constitution defines:

- The structure and limits of civic participation  
- The separation between governance, compliance, and execution  
- The lawful use of blockchain and AI in public infrastructure  
- The licensing and authority model (**TESL**) governing all TEOS systems  
- The **non-bypassable** flow of authority from charter to execution  

No component of the TEOS ecosystem may operate outside the scope defined by this
Constitution.
