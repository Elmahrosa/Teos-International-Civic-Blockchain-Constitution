# 🏛️ Sovereign Architecture Overview

This document defines the **authoritative sovereign architecture**
of the **TEOS / Elmahrosa Ecosystem**.

It establishes **how authority flows**, **where execution is allowed**,
and **which layers are non-negotiable** for any nation, institution,
or partner adopting TEOS.

## Core Doctrine

**Born in Egypt for the World**  
*Built in Egypt. Engineered for Nations. Scaled for the World.*

- Governance precedes technology  
- Law precedes protocol  
- Humans precede AI  
- Sovereignty precedes decentralization  

Web3 and AI are **execution tools**, never sources of authority.

---

## Constitutional Chain of Authority

All TEOS systems must operate under the following **mandatory order**:

1. **International Civic Blockchain Constitution**  
   Supreme constitutional authority

2. **TEOS-FORGE**  
   Governance stewardship & lifecycle control

3. **TEOS-Governance**  
   Policy, roles, decision logic, and enforcement rules

4. **TEOS-Egypt-Compliance-Kit**  
   Jurisdictional law & regulatory enforcement

5. **TEOS-AI-Guard**  
   AI safety gates (decision-support only)

6. **TEOS-AI-Auditor**  
   Audit, evidence, and traceability

7. **Teos-Sovereign-System**  
   Sovereign execution kernel

8. **TEOS-API-Sovereign**  
   Single governed API & SDK gateway

9. **External Apps / Partners / Nations**  
   Access only via governed interfaces

Any system that bypasses this chain is **non-compliant and unauthorized**.

---

## Architectural Principle

**Authority flows downward. Execution flows upward.**

- Constitution defines legitimacy  
- Governance defines permission  
- Compliance defines legality  
- Guard & Audit define safety and evidence  
- Kernel executes approved actions  
- APIs expose controlled access  

No layer may override a higher layer.

---

## Intended Audience

This architecture is designed for:

- Governments & regulators  
- Central banks & public institutions  
- National digital identity programs  
- UN / SDG-aligned digital public infrastructure  

It is **not** a DAO model and **not** community governance.

---

**TEOS Egypt Sovereign License (TESL)**.
