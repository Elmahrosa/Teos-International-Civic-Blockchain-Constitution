# 🔗 TEOS Sovereign Authority Chain
## Canonical Authority & Execution Hierarchy

This document defines the **non-negotiable authority and execution hierarchy**
governing the **TEOS / Elmahrosa Sovereign Stack**.

It applies to **all repositories, systems, APIs, AI modules, integrations, and deployments**
without exception.

This hierarchy is governed exclusively by the
**International Civic Blockchain Constitution** and enforced under the **TESL** license.

---

## 🏛️ Canonical Authority Flow

No system, component, or actor may operate outside the following authority chain:

```

International Civic Blockchain Constitution
↓
TEOS-FORGE
(Stewardship & Lifecycle Governance)
↓
TEOS-Governance
(Policy, Oversight & Decision Authority)
↓
TEOS-Compliance-Kit
(Jurisdictional & Regulatory Enforcement)
↓
TEOS-AI-Guard
(AI Safety Gates — Decision Support Only)
↓
TEOS-AI-Auditor
(Evidence Generation, Logging & Audit Export)
↓
Teos-Sovereign-System
(Sovereign Execution Kernel)
↓
TEOS-API-Sovereign
(Governed API & SDK Gateway)
↓
External Applications, Institutions, Nations & Partners

```

Any deviation, bypass, or reordering of this chain is **strictly prohibited**.

## ⚖️ Authority Enforcement Rules

The following rules are absolute and non-negotiable:

- Authority **always flows downward**
- Execution **never creates authority**
- Governance **precedes automation**
- Compliance **must be validated before execution**
- AI **never decides**; it supports human authority only
- APIs **may not bypass governance or compliance layers**
- Audit evidence **must exist for every state-changing action**

Any system or integration violating these rules is considered
**non-compliant, unauthorized, and invalid**.

---

## 🛡️ AI & Automation Constraints

- AI components are **advisory only**
- No AI model may:
  - Issue binding decisions
  - Override governance rules
  - Execute actions without human authorization
- All AI activity must be:
  - Logged
  - Auditable
  - Traceable to an accountable authority

There is **no autonomous governance** within the TEOS Sovereign Stack.

---

## 🌍 Sovereign Scope of Application

This authority model is explicitly designed for:

- National governments
- Central banks
- Regulatory authorities
- National digital platforms
- UN / SDG-aligned Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) programs

This is **not**:
- A DAO governance model
- A community-voting system
- A permissionless protocol

Sovereignty is institutional, constitutional, and state-aligned by design.

## 🌐 Constitutional Capacity Governance

### Regional Capacity Supremacy Rule

To preserve global multipolar balance and prevent institutional or geopolitical capture, the TEOS Sovereign Stack enforces the following rule:

> **No geopolitical region may exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of total global sovereign access capacity** across all active pilots, scaled deployments, or production systems.

This rule applies **cumulatively** and **irrevocably**, regardless of:
- Funding source (UN, IFI, bilateral, national)
- Institutional intermediaries
- Subsidiaries, consortiums, or special-purpose vehicles
- Deployment phase (pilot or production)

### Canonical Region Definitions

For constitutional accounting, regions are fixed as follows:

- **MENA** — Middle East & North Africa  
- **Africa** — Sub-Saharan Africa  
- **LATAM** — Latin America & Caribbean  
- **Europe** — EU + UK + EEA + Western Balkans  
- **North America** — United States & Canada  
- **East Asia** — China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan  
- **South & Southeast Asia** — ASEAN + Indian Subcontinent  

Regions **may not be subdivided, merged, or reclassified** to bypass capacity enforcement.

### Allocation Logic

- **OPEN:** Capacity available under the constitutional ceiling  
- **PRIORITY:** Preferred sequencing within the ceiling  
- **LIMITED:** Participation permitted only if unused capacity exists  

Unused capacity **expires** and does not roll over or transfer cross-region.

### Enforcement

Capacity enforcement is binding across:
- MoUs
- Pilot agreements
- RFPs
- Funding instruments
- Technical deployments

Any attempt to bypass this rule constitutes **constitutional non-compliance**.
