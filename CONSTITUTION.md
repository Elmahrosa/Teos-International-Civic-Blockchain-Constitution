## 🧭 Preamble

We, the stakeholders of the TEOS ecosystem — citizens, public servants, civic institutions,
technical custodians, and adopting jurisdictions — establish this Constitution as the
supreme charter governing civic-first blockchain infrastructure.

TEOS is born in Egypt, *Om el Donia (Mother of the World)*, a historical origin of law,
administration, and public order.  
This Constitution transforms Egyptian civic principles into exportable,
nation-ready **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)**.

This document is the **highest authority** governing all TEOS protocols, registries,
validators, institutions, contributors, and deployments.

No technical system, smart contract, vote, or automation may supersede this Constitution.

## 🧭 Foundational Mandates

1. Constitutional authority is supreme and sovereign.
2. Human governance precedes automation.
3. Civic legitimacy precedes economic activity.
4. Transparency, auditability, and accountability are mandatory.
5. Constitutional alignment is required before any protocol execution.
