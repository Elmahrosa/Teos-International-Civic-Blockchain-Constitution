# International Civic Blockchain Charter

## Purpose
This charter establishes the International Civic Blockchain Constitution under TEOS Egypt, integrating Pi Network civic modules to enable sovereign, compliance‑first digital governance.

## Coordinating Authority
Elmahrosa serves as the coordinating hub, anchoring Egypt’s role as the mythic center of civic blockchain sovereignty.

## Principles
- Petition‑first onboarding for all participants  
- Badge‑gated identity tiers: Citizen, Validator, Founder  
- Transparent treasury registry with dual verification  
- Immutable governance logs for institutional trust  
- Compliance‑first participation across all modules  

## Petition Enforcement
No contributor, nation, or treasury flow is valid without proof of petition signature.

## Governance
- Roles enforced via badges: Citizen, Validator, Founder  
- Modules operate exclusively through Pi SDK — zero external dependencies  
- Treasury actions require dual verification and ritual logging  
- All governance actions logged in `audits/transparency_log.md`  
- Treasury rules enforced via `compliance/treasury_rules.md`  
- Badge schema defined in `governance/badge_schema.json`  

## Transparency
All vaults and flows are tracked in `vault_registry.json` and audited through `audits/`.  

## Legal Safety
Nation‑level onboarding requires compliance templates and legal review to ensure lawful participation.  

## Ritual Logging
Every update is recorded in `chapter_resurrection.md` as a civic chapter, preserving the mythic continuity of governance.  

## Motto
**Sign With It — governance begins with petition and badge verification.**
