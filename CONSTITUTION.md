## 🧭 Preamble

We, the stakeholders of the TEOS ecosystem — citizens, public servants, civic institutions,
technical custodians, and adopting jurisdictions — establish this Constitution as the
**supreme charter** governing civic-first blockchain infrastructure.

TEOS is born in Egypt, *Om El Donia (Mother of the World)* — a historic origin of law,
administration, and public order.  
This Constitution transforms Egyptian civic governance principles into
**exportable, nation-ready Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)**.

This document constitutes the **highest authority** governing all TEOS protocols,
registries, validators, institutions, contributors, deployments, and integrations.

No technical system, smart contract, vote, automation, or AI process may supersede
this Constitution.
